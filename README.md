Hi, Iâ€™m Private Butts

I build, break, and fix things. Sometimes even on the computer.

I do a lotta bit of web dev, a little bit of game dev, and some embedded stuff on the side. I also do a bit of CAD and Blender when I'm feeling artsy.

When I go full luddite I can be found wandering around with a camera at least twice my age.

 - inquiries@privatebutts.dev

I have a neglected website here: [privatebutts.dev](https://privatebutts.dev)
